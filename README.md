# Music Store Scraper
A Scrapy (Python Framework) script to fetch all the instruments of a certain type (Bass, Guitar, Drums, etc)

## Work In Progress
Right now only fetches:
- Brand
- Name
- Rating
- Description
- URL


I'll start adding things to the pipelines, items, downloading images, more instrument information, etc
